Daredab is a fun, exciting, unique social network connecting people around fun social dares and challenges created by themselves. 

To achieve this, Daredab only allows three types of publications :
 
1 - Dare (post)
That's a post a user makes to dare others to do something fun, exciting.
For example : Dare others to take a selfie with a total stranger without asking their permission.

2 - Dab (post)
That's a post a user makes to respond to a Dare, to prove that he has completed the dare successfully. 
For example : In response to the 'selfie with a stranger' Dare, post your own selfie with a stranger near you.

3 - Challenge (post)
When a Dare is interesting, generates enough dabs, Daredab sets a prize and an expiration date on it : that Dare becomes a Challenge. The Dab with the most votes wins the prize, the Challenge.
For example : selfie with a stranger challenge or selfie with a star challenge.","Have fun, Challenge the world, and Win",1,http://www.daredab.com,2018-02-12T10:46:32.000Z,2018-02-12T12:10:50.000Z,,,,,,,"The World",Yaounde,1-10,"Mobile Social Network",,"https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/859/559/859559-8e5fd4bc15b44656fe452d11f83c694cc21256a8.jpg?1518434051, https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/859/560/859560-652dad34388197a9cf4e10997621fbcbab4ecac2.jpg?1518434133, https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/859/563/859563-551884ba830c0af9e665de75bda4f99904c15520.jpg?1518434207, https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/859/564/859564-79f68c0c7edf62f565db4fd099a22faa4a805208.jpg?1518434287, https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/859/573/859573-61c81b50ab6aaab7e6323ae2017085cf12b34a5f.png?1518435750, https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/859/574/859574-d092831c7385fd26b6b1ace99f87bc2cb9cf4916.png?1518435881"

Aurion is aim to highlight the beauty and exoticism of Africa through the African fantasy. The gameplay is inspired by the series ""Tales of"" and wants to be very dynamic and creative in a richly colored universe.
In game, you play as Enzo Kori-Odan, Prince of Zama. The day of your coronation and wedding with Erine Evou, you suffer a coup d’état orchestrated by your brother in law Ngarba Evou. Exiled, you go around the world with Erine looking for support. You must find your particular Aurionique Heritage to regain the throne.

Because there has never been an African A-RPG game on the gaming market, our target is the worldwide core-gamers. We innovate by bringing new blood to the gaming industry, a new story and experience!

The final version of Aurion will be on sale by April 2016 in digital download on STEAM.
