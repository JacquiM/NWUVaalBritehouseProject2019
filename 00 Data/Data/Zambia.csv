By catching users while they are having or planning to have fun, corporates have an opportunity to associate their brand with their prospective customer when he is most relaxed. As with watching TV the advertiser seeks to engage the customer when the customer is least stressed and using the app at ‘relaxed attention’.

As a result, when well executed, connecting business with users at fun event(such as a party) creates an opportunity to generate leads for a business.","A social network that links users and busineses in a way that promotes fun events ",2,http://giglea.com,2014-12-01T09:31:47.000Z,2015-02-16T18:33:22.000Z,,http://twitter.com/gigleanet,,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1JdNP21t8U,"Social Media, Advertising, Entertainment, Europe",Lusaka,,,,"https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/438/903/438903-63fe7f3657797f2bdcdafd7bf9e71a2c8339a104.PNG?1417427590, https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/438/904/438904-3fc23ec92cd6b5f23207b022a05b5bb2715d5bbf.PNG?1417427644"

Infogram is a simple and beautiful way to connect and share interests together.

Infogram is being built out of the idea that access to the right information at the right time, anywhere can help people make informed decisions.

So, think of Infogram as connected groups and each group is called gram. People come together to form a gram which can be shared to others for common good (doesn’t sound like mathematics, right?).  Infogram is yet to be open for public use and it may not be now. Once its launched, it will be free for everybody to use.

Infogram is currently being built for SMS and web using open source technologies.","Salebox is a sales company using technology to connect buyers and sellers.",2,http://www.salebox.world,2013-08-07T23:01:33.000Z,2018-04-26T14:29:41.000Z,,,,,,,"African-American, East Africa, South Africa",Zambia,11-50,"Limited Company",,
