Many people are moving from traditional JPG, PNG and TIF image to PDF formats. Much of this is because of how an image is stored on one's computer. Standard photo formats are designed to shrink the picture by up to 90%, compressing the file to save disk space. However, this compression results in a slight to moderate corruption of the image when it is opened later or with a different program. Because PDF is universal and self-compressing, this is not a common problem with image to PDF conversion. Even better, these images can be incorporated into other PDF documents quickly and easily without sacrificing image quality. This is why having access to a good image to PDF converter can make a big difference in how your images look on a flyer, in a report or as an illustration in a novel. To convert Image to PDF : 1. Select your image (up to 100Mb) 2. Put your email (optional) 3. Click convert 4. Processing 5.

NINAYO is a virtual marketplace where large and small agricultural producers can post their products in Swahili or English via internet or SMS.  These posts are searchable by heat map or simple query of agricultural businesses by price, location, type and quantity.
