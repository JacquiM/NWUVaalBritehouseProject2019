Because most of its 3000 members are very poor the movement has historically sought money from outsiders. However, the leaders of the movement have gradually identified dependency, rather than just poverty, as their problem. In February, 2014, they made the commitment to become self-sustaining and asked Hope In View, Inc, for technical help. The two organizations are embarking on a training program to help all of the movement’s members learn to start small businesses and to tithe their income to .help support their movement financially They are also training all 33 of their churches in better accounting methods. If they are successful in making this change, they will serve as role models for others trapped in dependency in this very poor country.
