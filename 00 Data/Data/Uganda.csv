At BUSHMEMORIES we provide holidays with a focus on adventure, conservation and sustainable tourism.  We are unique in that we can also arrange for you to undertake volunteer work at local organizations.  This will allow you to fully experience the country you are visiting, while supporting local communities in Africa.

We are very aware in how our choices impact wildlife and the planet; we therefore promote and encourage making sound ethical travel choices. Our business is the result of our passion for life and our inherent love of nature and wild places.
In short, we aim to give you more than just a holiday in Africa.

Lack of enough funds incapacitates my ability to translate ideas into reality yet we have land,local resources and some necessary skills.i developed the idea of a piggery project.The project once put fully on ground has a quick return on investment,a high multiplier effect and a vast market.it can employ over 20 youth group .Estimates show that the whole project needs US Dollars 15,956 to be
