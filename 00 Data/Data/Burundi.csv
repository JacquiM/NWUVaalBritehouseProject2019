Our main activities focus on supply of the 3T's, being Tungsten, Tantalite and Tin Ores. These are supplied to global smelters that turn it into finished and final products that are used in a variety of industries in a variety of forms.Â 

Our operation is fully transparent, and we have all the right equipment already purchases and deployed, plus a working area in the heart of the industrial area and more importantly, Government licences to allow us to export, and international licences to accredit us as providing Conflict Free Minerals to global markets.

We have spent one year establishing the operation and now we are looking at raising money to improve our logistics efficiency. We are looking at scaling up to sea shipping, currently we are air shipping. Sea shipping allows great cost savings compared to air, but needs more capital, and has greater competitive advantages.","Transparent Mineral Trading",3,http://www.aumercat.com,2014-11-23T07:09:46.000Z,2016-06-22T06:54:30.000Z,,,,,http://au.linkedin.com/pub/john-kerekes/20/483/b74,,"Commodities, Minerals",Burundi,1-10,,"Aumercat signed a supply contract for a trial shipment to a prominent global smelter on the 28th of Nov and is preparing its first export.",
