LuckyLoo will be the FIRST and only public toilet operator in Liberia, utilizing the collected waste to produce organic fertilizer (a critical element of Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's largest initiative: local agriculture), and eventually, the Country's first Waste2Energy treatment center.

Public defecation is a major issue in Liberia's capital city, and is becoming a growing health concern. Personal toilets, or latrines, are too expensive for the urban poor to build and maintain, so most people simply opt for the public streets.

At one point in West Point, one of the worst slums in the world, there were fewer than 10 public, non-maintained, bathrooms for a population of more than 60,000.
