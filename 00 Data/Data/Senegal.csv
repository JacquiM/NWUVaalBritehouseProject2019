Indeed, most solutions proposed in this area are subject to a heavy initial investment and a painful maintenance. Sunubus responds to this problem by motivating everyone to use their phone as a means of locating transmission lines.

The operating principle is simple:
- Modou, passenger of line 5, shares his position in real time via SunuBus
- Fatou pays with her phone credit in order to access it.
- Once Fatou gets on the bus, Modou receives points that he can subsequently exchange for gifts (credit, internet pass, ...)

Sunubus is the only technology to offer a reliable bus tracking service with no deployment or maintenance costs.","Sunubus is a collaborative mobile application for bus localization and transport lines",4,https://www.sunubus.com,2018-01-20T19:25:21.000Z,2018-01-20T19:32:21.000Z,,,,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIRxn0X4z1M,"Mobile, SaaS, Smart City",Dakar,,,,"https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/855/447/855447-2d56855074123c41500737c8e42acbd5cd3e285c.png?1516476565, https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/855/448/855448-03e90df0b7eb92990a8b45e536564536960c6fa4.jpg?1516477430, https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/855/449/855449-3ac88d3608beb1c7477d07fa1b8befd8a0a259ae.jpg?1516477527"

IHDakar is an opportunity to serve visitors as the first Eco-Hostel in Senegal. Our cause, ""Setal"" places street trash containers in communities while offering jobs.

WHERE?

Senegal's major city and capital: Dakar

WHO?

Majority of tourists travel from Europe, Asia and the United States. Our average customer is in their early 30's from abroad. 

WHY?

With IHDakar, we can participate in the economic development of Dakar with an increase in business and jobs for locals. While bringing opportunity, we also make it easier on wallets with a large number of travelers consistently seeking affordable accommodations in an overpriced, old fashioned hotel industry. In offering an eco-friendly environment, we challenge the outdated patterns.
