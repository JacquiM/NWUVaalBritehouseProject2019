Our app provides a simple way for daily or any periodical stock counts and for the recording of daily purchases and sales as inventory management is the cornerstone of most micro-entrepreneurs’ businesses. 

Our solution therefore provides an easy way to manage inventories, analyse profitability for individual inventory line items, manage reorder levels and track daily cash receipt. The VasBox app is much more than just a stock taking app as it also provides reports and analysis to assist the entrepreneur with basic business decisions such as:

a.	Identifying the fast moving goods
b.	Identifying line items are the most profitable
