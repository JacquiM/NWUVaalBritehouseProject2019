In Nairobi Kenya, for example,  few cooks can make nutritious ""Swahili Pilau""
  ii.) Because of land fragmentation that has pervaded Kenya, many small scale farmers are not able to grow to a scale that warrants the huge cost of distribution. At the same time, the local market does not have a good market for their produce. To resolve this issue, we envisages to provide an online platform for small-scale farmers to market their produce provide the logistics needed to have these produce reach customers.

Takamoto Biogas is a rapidly growing renewable energy company in Nairobi providing biogas systems to small farmers in rural Kenya.  

Building on two years of market research and installation experience, we have developed a new business model and technology that will bring the many benefits of biogas energy to the masses in Kenya by eliminating the main hurdle to its adoption – the high upfront cost.

Our new technology overcomes the biggest hurdle in biogas implementation, reducing the initial cost to consumers from KES 100,000 per unit by 85%.  In Kenya alone, there are two million farmers with at least one cow who are potential clients.  We have piloted the new technology in Githunguri, and have now installed 300 systems. Having proven the demand, we are now preparing to scale up our operations.","Biofuel from farm waste",3,http://www.takamotobiogas.com,2016-03-06T05:00:54.000Z,2017-05-20T15:49:56.000Z,http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/%2Forganization%2Ftakamoto-biogas,,,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7p1VHADLC4,"Financial Services, Clean Energy",Nairobi,,,,https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/812/126/812126-594330bb5f504ff45a381607d1095fa1a3a3d59a.jpg?1495295062

M-KOPA Solar, headquartered in Nairobi, Kenya, is the global leader of “pay-as-you-go” energy for off-grid customers. Since its commercial launch in October 2012, M-KOPA has connected more than 250,000 homes in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda to solar power, and is now adding over 500 new homes each day.

The success of M-KOPA (M= mobile, KOPA= to borrow) stems from making solar products affordable to low-income households on a pay-per-use installment plan. Customers acquire solar systems for a small deposit and then buy daily usage “credits” for US $0.45, or less than the price of traditional kerosene lighting. After one year of payments customers own their solar systems outright and can upgrade to more power.

All revenues are collected in real-time via mobile money (such as M-PESA in Kenya) and embedded GSM sensors in each system allow M-KOPA to monitor real time performance and regulate usage based on payment.","Power for everyone",11,http://www.m-kopa.com,2015-11-16T12:46:19.000Z,2015-11-16T12:54:56.000Z,http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/%2Forganization%2Fm-kopa,,,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=048wWFgZqXo,"Clean Energy",Nairobi,,,,https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/617/307/617307-bbf731694825d674fd0d865f14299e6ee57cc086.jpg?1447678448

Second, the platform allows buyers to make payments using the popular mobile payment system called Mpesa.

Third issue is addressed by partnering with local courier firms to ensure we have end to end visibility of the pickup and delivery process.

Simplex is a buy-sell-deliver mobile commerce platform that applies fast optimization algorithms to find the cheapest option to buy and deliver a set of goods.
 
How we do it?
In fulfilling shopping lists for multiple buyers, Simplex compares both item prices from different sellers and prices of different delivery drivers (including Uber-like shared delivery) and quickly computes optimal overall savings to buy and deliver. Additionally, Simplex aggregates orders and compares several price points for wholesale buying – connecting wholesalers and producers directly with buyers. The result : up to 30%  lower cost for the buyer over buying themselves. Sellers profit from expanded footprint without having to worry about fulfilment.
 
Business model
A small Simplex fee plus a portion of optimization-enabled savings (shared with buyers) generates a more profitable company value proposition than that of other e-commerce solution providers.","Buy-sell-deliver mobile commerce platform ",4,http://corporate.simplexpoint.com/,2015-05-06T20:17:35.000Z,2016-12-06T22:06:36.000Z,http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/%2Forganization%2Fsimplex-point,http://twitter.com/@simplextz,,,,,"Mobile Commerce, Optimization, Supply Chain Management, Same Day Delivery",Nairobi,1-10,,,"https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/519/476/519476-ea029c71d9a519155f0a8d2899383b99078e6bba.png?1430944069, https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/519/477/519477-45f467a8cd6dfb180f4869f9bd41ff21020d8714.png?1430944118, https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/519/478/519478-74885dd98a39b981e58d2bc4348ccb4199642cb0.png?1430944155"

Financial inclusion has increased in Kenya with more people accessing formal financial services. 
However, the financial capability of Kenyans has to catch up with these advances. According to the FINACCESS NATIONAL SURVEY conducted in 2013, sources of financial advice by banks or FMIs range from 11% (women) to 17% (men). 55% of women and 45% of men are more likely to receive advice from family and friends. 
The scale of coaching small business owners is limited. 
Therefore SMEs need to find a way to improve their business financial capabilities in a cost-effective manner fit to their reality to become fully independant in financial decision making.

We propose sharing stories of successful SMEs in a short audio format. The concerned listeners, only required to own a phone, will learn about the challenges of running a business by identifying themselves with the story teller. What were the encountered problems ?

Our software is used by hundreds of drug shops and clinics in Africa to support hundreds of thousands of patients each year.
 
For the people who use our software, it represents a way of tracking business decisions and accessing deals and working capital. For patients, we help strengthen supply chains and ensure that the medicine that they buy will be competitively priced and consistently high quality, in a setting where 1 in 10 products is counterfeit or substandard.","Technology advancing primary care in East Africa",22,http://maishameds.org,2014-10-08T09:35:12.000Z,2017-12-09T00:16:09.000Z,,https://twitter.com/maishameds,,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/maisha-meds,,"East Africa",Kisumu,1-10,,,https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/508/039/508039-6308c9a8f9df68344680b4b03594dc9170ea6ebb.JPG?1429160350

Accelerate emerging market growth with a physical address system.

The problem
Imagine life without a physical address… you wouldn’t get any to-the-door post, banks wouldn’t trust you enough to issue you a loan and an ambulance would struggle to find you, maybe even arriving too late.

Today, that’s the life for 4 billion people in the world. The growth of the countries that these 4 billion people live in is being inherently throttled by the lack of physical address system.

The solution
OkHi gives everyone a physical address, for free. Your OkHi address consists of a GPS point and a photo of your gate and is easily shared via the OkHi mobile app.

With an OkHi address you can now get deliveries to your door, get access to more finance and have the confidence that emergency services will find you in time.","Addressing Emerging Markets",127,http://www.okhi.com,2014-06-09T13:41:37.000Z,2015-10-28T11:39:02.000Z,http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/okhi,,,,,http://www.okhi.com/video,"E-Commerce, Logistics, Same Day Delivery","London, Nairobi",,,,

They also target mass production and keeping the costs low. so the bread is very basic, not good quality.

I plan to start a bakery with a difference. i will add nutritional, taste and cost value to my bread. I will employ my own distribution initially using motor bikes then trucks to near towns.this will eliminate the wholesalers and other distributors ensuring that my bread will be cheaper in the market by up to 10 shillings.
My bread will have margarine so better tasting,softer and with added nutrients.
I will have flavors like vanilla and strawberry in my bread to make it more competitive.","The best baked goods in Kenya",2,https://www.facebook.com/pngari,2014-01-16T08:27:47.000Z,2016-12-06T21:55:02.000Z,http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/manoma-bakeries,http://twitter.com/@patrickngari,,,,,"Social Media",Kenya,1-10,"Startup, Food & Tech",,

Yet a lack of capital means that they cannot afford to buy in bulk and pay to travel long distances to markets every day to buy just enough stock that will help them get by.

We are now building a comprehensive suite of technologies and systems to support scaling of the entire value chain, from planting seedlings to running sawmills. We have ambitious plans to grow into Africa's leading forestry company, creating life-changing income for millions of poor farmers.","The new face of African forestry",18,http://komaza.com,2013-02-28T21:30:33.000Z,2017-05-28T14:30:56.000Z,http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/%2Forganization%2Fkomaza,https://twitter.com/komaza,,,https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/239650/,,"Green, Natural Resources, Agriculture, Wood","Kilifi, Palo Alto",201-500,,,https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/813/575/813575-9d7dc95a62999b52ff0efa784aa9ee488a4b861a.jpg?1495980685
