In English-Speaking countries, cacao is called cocoa. Ghana is the world's second largest cacao/cocoa bean producer. The beans are usually sold to international traders who then uses them to make chocolate.

Cocoa is the chief agricultural export of Ghana and the country's main cash crop. All cocoa beans produced in the country must be sold to licensed buyers or the government agency called Cocoa Marketing Board. All international exports are controlled by the government of Ghana, but there are around 25 private companies buying the crop in all areas of the country. Farmers are guaranteed a minimum floor price (cocoa minimum price: 1,700 American Dollars per metric ton). I am looking for reliable investors to help me grow this cocoa farming company in Ghana.

This situation provides them with only a handful of options which include:

Borrow from family and friends.

rentGH provides a solution to this problem by providing a system that pre-finances properties for rent and makes them available for renters to pay monthly.

A SnooCODE is a 6 or 7-digit alphanumeric geolocation code that acts like a UK post code or a US Zip Code except over 200 x more precise. It can be used to provide directions to any location and is accurate to within less than 7 metres.

SnooCODEs are simple, easy to remember for nations operating in different languages. The application can work offline, without credit or connection to a network, allowing it to be robust even when the infrastructure is not.

The problem that SnooCODE solves is bigger than not knowing where people are located. We provide a technology to support poor countries in leapfrogging traditional systems, on which we can build to answer their specific needs and help them cheetah charge towards world-class standards.

So my idea briefly - 
1.I own this domain name - SkyeMall.com - which i think is appropriate. 
2. I have access to  an excellent script, with a little tweaking - incorporate local online payment platforms, commissions etc. - will be ideal.
3. SkyeMall will handle all deliveries between buyers and sellers, start from local area Accra etc.. Using and starting with two or three nimble motorbikes, or popular keke tricycles to navigate local traffic.
4. Estimate initial investment less than $50,000, with continuous marketing taking bulk.With effective marketing, I think this business could grow to become part of the growing online eCommerce boom in Africa.
So below is my profile on LinkedIn, I have the idea but looking for capital. I do appreciate it if you do read this, and if not interest, I will appreciate any advice etc..

We have a twelve acre parcel of land on Lake Volta in the Volta Region of Ghana.  Lake Volta is the largest manmade lake in the world and to date; there has been little development of vacation or recreational venues for visitors and residents.
Our property is adjacent to the bustling town of Kpando, which attracts many visitors who come to volunteer in the local orphanages and villages to teach or provide health care.  While there are many wonderful tourist attractions in this area, accommodations are woefully lacking as is the organized tour guidance.
After discussions with many government officials and local residents about our project, we are very encouraged about the development of our project.

Maternal mortality remains unacceptably high across much of the developing world, including Ghana. Maternal mortality related to pregnancy is the leading cause of mortality in women of child-bearing age and perinatal mortality standing at more than 6 million per year worldwide represents an increasingly high proportion of childhood deaths. Almost all of the maternal and perinatal deaths occur in the developing world. While many resource poor countries are committed to improving maternal outcomes, they need significant support to tackle this multifaceted problem. (isuog, 2015)

Our Android app provides users with engaging lessons which help them gain points towards an alternative credit score.

In addition we have secured great cultivation sites and entered into partnerships for sophisticated and cost effective refining technologies. We have made preliminary agreements with buyers and parties willing to develop our sales channel, incl. a sugar giant. We have good relations with both the Ghanaian and Dutch government. 

To finance this project we decided to set up an impact fund with the potential to finance other projects too. By year end we hope to have raised 6m EUR.

Demand is strong locally and internationally for carbon friendly alternative transport. Bamboo bicycles consist of frames manufactured from native bamboo, sisal fiber, resin epoxy and other durable components, and assembled with parts such as a seat, handlebars, chain wheels, chains, and tires, which are sourced from reliable local and overseas suppliers. Bamboo bicycles are comparable or superior to current steel and carbon fiber bicycles both in terms of quality and suitability for multiple rider needs. The tensile strength of bamboo is 28,000 Newton per square inch, which is greater than that of steel, thus making the bamboo bikes a highly stable mode of transportation generally, and particularly ideal for rough terrain. It is also more environmentally friendly than steel. Bamboo bicycles can also be used for cargo transportation. We serve students, tourists, general public and local farmers.","Designed from Nature",9,http://www.booomers.com,2014-04-05T18:11:06.000Z,2015-05-06T19:35:30.000Z,http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/%2Forganization%2Fbooomers-international,http://twitter.com/@booomersbikes,,https://www.facebook.com/booomersint,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1059274?trk=tyah&trkInfo=tarId%3A1409004766163%2Ctas%3Abooome%2Cidx%3A2-1-3,,"Sports, Transportation, Green Consumer Goods",Accra,,,,

To address this challenge, Farmerline Ltd has developed a mobile-web based application that communicates timely and relevant agricultural information (such as weather alerts, best farm practices, financial tips, market prices and market access) through recorded voice messages to farmers’ mobile phones. The messages are sent in local languages and can be used to support NGOs and agricultural organizations as they deliver services and collect data. 

Farmerline’s voice technology does not only bridge the illiteracy barrier but it also reduces the cost of communication and data collection for small-scale farmers and organizations working with them.
